# A python tool to convert FNF v0.8.1 songs over to Kade Engine.
## Usage:
Before using, make sure that all of these requirements are already installed onto your python (ONLY do this if the script somehow doesn't install the liraries included below):
- **sys**
- **os**
- **typing**
- **re**

These may have already been installed, and if so, you can now run the python script!

> [!NOTE]
> If the convertor doesn't work, you can tell me at my dc (test077869), I'll try to update the script as fast as I can.
