# A python tool to convert FNF v0.8.1 songs over to Kade Engine.
> [!WARNING]
> I tried my best to make this translator as best as possible, but due to my kinda bad coding skills the convertor may not work right.
>
> This goes for hit sections and probably notes too. If you want to fix that you will have to manually change those yourself.
## Usage:
### [VC.PY](https://github.com/juliusxpn/FNF-v0.8.1-Charting-Convertor/raw/refs/heads/main/VC.PY)
## How to use?:
Before using, make sure that all of these requirements are already installed onto your python (ONLY do this if the script somehow doesn't install the liraries included below):
- **sys**
- **os**
- **typing**
- **re**
- **tkinter**

These may have already been installed, and if so, you can now run the python script!
## Patch Notes:
```
1. Fixed notes being placed weirdly during convertion.
2. Made it so both characters can now sing.
```
